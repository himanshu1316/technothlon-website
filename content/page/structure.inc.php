                section has its own marking scheme. It is held nationwide, at selected cities on the 2nd Sunday of the month
                of July.</p>

                While Mains is an event based competition. The selected teams compete against each other of the same squad
                to complete the events. Each team will have to face 3 events from which top 5 teams from each squad will be
                selected for the Final Showdown. The events, like prelims, do not require any prerequisite knowledge and
                students will be taught any extra knowledge they require. The events will vary every year. In addition to
                these students can attend the workshops and fun events to spend the night. Mains is conducted during
                “Techniche”, the Techno-Management Festival of IIT Guwahati, held during the first week of September. Other
                than events, the students can witness the competitions of Techniche, attend the Lecture Series of famous
                personalities and watch laser shows and Nite performances.</p>
